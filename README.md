#### USER STORIES

Tech Tackles project uses a [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/hpcoloma/projects/10) to manage and track progress throughout the development cycle. The Kanban board visualizes work stages, from initial backlog through to completed tasks, facilitating efficient task management and smooth workflow. This approach allows me to prioritize tasks, track progress, and ensure that all features and improvements are delivered in a timely manner.

- **MoSCoW Prioritization**

  In managing the development of Tech Tackles, the MoSCoW method is utilized to prioritize features and tasks. This method categorizes tasks into four groups:

  - **Must Have:** Critical features that are essential for the system's functionality and must be implemented.
  - **Should Have:** Important features that are not critical but add significant value to the system.
  - **Could Have:** Features that are desirable but not essential and can be included if time and resources permit.
  - **Won't Have:** Features that are not a priority for the current development cycle but may be considered for future iterations.

- **As a User:**
  - I want to register for an account so that I can submit and track support tickets.
  - I want to log in to my account, so that I can access the IT Support Ticketing System.

## Bugs and Potential issues
- Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript Loading Issues
  - Problem: The application has encountered issues loading Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files correctly, resulting in error like:
    
    'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'backdrop').'
  - Steps taken to Resolve:
    - Checked the CDN URL directly in the browser by verifying that the url  "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" displays raw CSS instead of HTM or error page. URL is accessible.
    - Verified Integrity attribute. I used the [SRI Hash Generator](https://www.srihash.org/) to verify the hash.
    - Checked Cross-Origin Attribute: Confirmed that the crossorigin="anonymous" attribute is used correctly, which is necessary for CORS with CDNs.
    - Attempted to Use Local Bootstrap File:
      - Downloaded the Bootstrap CSS file and placed it in the static folder of the project. - Updated the URL paths in the template accordingly.
      - Ran python manage.py collectstatic to ensure the static files are collected and served properly.
      - Encountered issues with local file serving, potentially due to misconfiguration or incorrect file paths.

![Bootstrap Error](static/images/bugs_js.PNG)
  - Resolution: Despite the above steps taken, error on the browser still appearing. Conclusion is that this is down to the Bootstrap library that I dont have control with.

## Development
This application was develop in Code Institute Gitpod, hosted in GitHub and deployed in Heroku.
## Deployment on Heroku
The site was deployed via Heroku.
### Project Deployment
To deploy the project through Heroku:
- Login to Heroku
- Create a new Heroku application by going to the Dashboard and select New and Create New App
- Give your app a name (pp4-techtackles-by-hc) and choose the region nearest to you (Europe). This will create an app in Heroku and will redirect you to the Deploy tab.
- On the Deploy tab, connect your Github and search for your repository.
- Manually deploy the main branch of this GitHub repo.
- On the Resources tab, ensure eco-dyno is enabled and delete any Postgres database Add-on.
- Add the KEY - DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with the Value - 1 to the config vars, this must be removed before final deployment.
- Add the database to the app by going to Settings tab, under Config vars add the following:
  Key= Database_URL
  Value = your postgres url
- In your Django app, make sure you install gunicorn~=20.1 and freeze it to the requirements.txt file.
- Create a new file env.py on the root directory and import the os library and set the environment variable for the DATABASE_URL the same as your settings in Heroku.
- Add SECRET_KEY using the os.environ in the env.py and add the same SECRET_KEY on the settings tab in Heroku under Config vars
- In the settings.py file within the django app, import Path from pathlib, import os and import dj_database_url
- Insert the line if os.path.isfile("env.py"): import env
- Update the default SECRET_KEY that Django has on settings.py and replace it with SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
- On settings.py, replace the database section with DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
}
- Settings.py file - add the STATIC files settings - the url, storage path, directory path, root path, media url and default file storage path.
- Link the file to the templates directory in Heroku TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')
- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR - 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list the format will be the app name given in Heroku when creating the app followed by .herokuapp.com
- Create a new file on the top level directory - Procfile
- Add web: gunicorn projectname.wsgi in Procfile.
- During production, do add, commit and push changes to your Github repo.
- In Heroku, under Deploy tab, click Deploy Branch.
- Watch out for any errors.
- Heroku will now build the app for you. Once it has completed the build process you will see a 'Your App Was Successfully Deployed' message and a link to the app to visit the live site.

### Forking your repository
To fork a repository on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Repository: Go to the GitHub repository you want to fork. You can do this by entering the repository URL in your browser or by searching for the repository on GitHub.

2. Find the "Fork" Button: On the repository page, you'll see a button labeled "Fork" in the top right corner of the page, next to the "Star" and "Watch" buttons. Click on the "Fork" button.

3. Choose where to Fork: GitHub will prompt you to choose where you want to fork the repository. You can fork it to your personal GitHub account or to any organizations you're a member of. Select the desired location.

4. Wait for the Fork to Complete: GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your account or organization. Depending on the size of the repository and the current server load, this process may take a few moments.

5. Access Your Forked Repository: Once the forking process is complete, you'll be redirected to your forked copy of the repository. You can now clone the repository to your local machine, make changes, and push them to your fork.

6. Keep Your Fork Synced: If you forked a repository to contribute changes back to the original repository, you may want to keep your fork up-to-date with the original repository. You can do this by configuring an "upstream" remote and pulling changes from it periodically.

That's it! You've successfully forked a repository on GitHub. You can now start working with the code in your fork, making changes, and contributing back to the original repository through pull requests.

### Clone Repository
Cloning a repository from GitHub allows you to copy a remote repository to your local machine. To clone a repository from GitHub to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Find the Repository: Go to the GitHub repository you want to clone. You can do this by entering the repository URL in your browser or by searching for the repository on GitHub.

2. Copy the Repository URL: On the repository page, click on the "Code" button. This will reveal a URL for the repository. Click on the clipboard icon to copy the URL to your clipboard.

3. Open Terminal (or Command Prompt): Open your terminal or command prompt on your local machine. You can usually find it in your applications or by searching for "Terminal" (on macOS and Linux) or "Command Prompt" (on Windows).

4. Navigate to the Directory Where You Want to Clone the Repository: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. For example, if you want to clone the repository into a folder named "projects" in your home directory, you would use the following command:

        cd ~/projects

5. Clone the Repository: Once you're in the directory where you want to clone the repository, use the git clone command followed by the repository URL you copied earlier. For example, if the repository URL is https://github.com/username/repository.git, you would use the following command:

        git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
6. Enter Your GitHub Credentials (if prompted): If the repository is private and requires authentication, you may be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password or personal access token.

7. Wait for the Cloning Process to Complete: Git will clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Depending on the size of the repository and your internet connection speed, this process may take some time.

8. Access the Cloned Repository: Once the cloning process is complete, you'll have a local copy of the repository on your machine. You can navigate into the repository directory using the cd command and start working with the files.

That's it! You've successfully cloned a repository from GitHub to your local machine. You can now make changes to the files, commit them, and push them back to the repository on GitHub if you have write access.
